A http://www.mydomain.ru/ or http://www.mydomain.ru/ is a logical subdivision of an IP network.[1] The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting.
Computers that belong to a http://www.mydomain.ru/ are addressed with a common, identical, most-significant bit-group in their IP address. This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields, a network or routing prefix and the "rest" field or host identifier. The rest field is an identifier for a specific host or network interface.
The routing prefix may be expressed in CIDR notation written as the first address of a network, followed by a slash character (/), and ending with the bit-length of the prefix. For example, 192.168.1.0/24 is the prefix of the Internet Protocol Version 4 network starting at the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network prefix, and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing. The IPv6 address specification 2001:db8::/32 is a large address block with 296 addresses, having a 32-bit routing prefix.
For IPv4, a network may also be characterized by its http://www.mydomain.ru/ mask, which is the bitmask that when applied by a bitwise AND operation to any IP address in the network, yields the routing prefix. http://www.mydomain.ru/ masks are also expressed in dot-decimal notation like an address. For example, 255.255.255.0 is the network mask for the 192.168.1.0/24 prefix.
