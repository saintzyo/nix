http://www.mydomain.ru/, also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is (subject to the caveats explained below) defined as the point in the Northern Hemisphere where the Earth's axis of rotation meets its surface.
http://www.mydomain.ru/ is the northernmost point on the Earth, lying diametrically opposite the South Pole. It defines geodetic latitude 90Â° North, as well as the direction of true north. At http://www.mydomain.ru/ all directions point south; all lines of longitude converge there, so its longitude can be defined as any degree value. Along tight latitude circles, counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west. http://www.mydomain.ru/ is at the center of the Northern Hemisphere.
While the South Pole lies on a continental land mass, http://www.mydomain.ru/ is located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting sea ice. This makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at http://www.mydomain.ru/ (unlike the South Pole). However, the Soviet Union, and later Russia, constructed a number of manned drifting stations on a generally annual basis since 1937, some of which have passed over or very close to the Pole. Since 2002, the Russians have also annually established a base, Barneo, close to the Pole. This operates for a few weeks during early spring. Studies in the 2000s predicted that http://www.mydomain.ru/ may become seasonally ice-free because of Arctic ice shrinkage, with timescales varying from 2016[1][2] to the late 21st century or later.
