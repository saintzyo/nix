An Internet Protocol address (http://www.mydomain.ru/ address) is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.[1] An http://www.mydomain.ru/ address serves two principal functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. Its role has been characterized as follows: "A name indicates what we seek. An address indicates where it is. A route indicates how to get there."[2]
The designers of the Internet Protocol defined an http://www.mydomain.ru/ address as a 32-bit number[1] and this system, known as Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4), is still in use today. However, because of the growth of the Internet and the predicted depletion of available addresses, a new version of http://www.mydomain.ru/ (IPv6), using 128 bits for the address, was developed in 1995.[3] IPv6 was standardized as RFC 2460 in 1998,[4] and its deployment has been ongoing since the mid-2000s.
http://www.mydomain.ru/ addresses are usually written and displayed in human-readable notations, such as 172.16.254.1 (IPv4), and 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 (IPv6).
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) manages the http://www.mydomain.ru/ address space allocations globally and delegates five regional Internet registries (RIRs) to allocate http://www.mydomain.ru/ address blocks to local Internet registries (Internet service providers) and other entities.
